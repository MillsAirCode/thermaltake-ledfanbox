## Device Information
- **Device**: Thermaltake LEDFanBox
- **USB Vendor ID**: 264a
- **USB Product ID**: 232b
- **Device Type**: HID (Human Interface Device)
- **Endpoints**: 
  - IN endpoint: 0x81 (Interrupt, 64 bytes)
  - OUT endpoint: 0x01 (Interrupt, 64 bytes)
- **Status**: Currently detected and appears to be working

## Conversation Topics
1. **Firmware Development** - User asked about writing custom firmware for Thermaltake Sync controller
2. **Driver Development** - User wants to create a Linux driver for fan speed and RGB control
3. **OpenRGB** - Discussed using OpenRGB as reference/alternative
4. **linux_thermaltake_riing** - Found Python-based driver project that might help

## Technical Findings
- Device uses HID protocol with interrupt transfers
- Found project: https://github.com/chestm007/linux_thermaltake_riing (Python driver/daemon)
- OpenRGB supports many controllers but not sure about this specific model
- Recommended approaches:
  1. Use linux_thermaltake_riing as reference
  2. Fork OpenRGB and modify USB communication layer
  3. Use HIDAPI Python module

## Current Status
- Device is detected by Linux
- User is interested in creating a custom driver
- Exploring Python-based driver options
- Next steps: Install dependencies and test communication
